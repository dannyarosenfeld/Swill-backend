# Swill (Back-End)
This is the back-end portion for [Swill](https://github.com/srozenboim/Swill). It was created using Ruby on Rails.

This backend includes a database which allows a user to:
* Sign up a new account
* Login
* Save their favorite drinks
* View their favorite drinks on their profile page

This back-end API returns JSON objects to the front-end. It is deployed using Heroku: [https://swill-backend.herokuapp.com/](https://swill-backend.herokuapp.com/)
